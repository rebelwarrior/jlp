      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. candidate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://math.njit.edu/&#34;&gt;Mathematical Sciences Department&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.njit.edu/&#34;&gt;New Jersey Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;. I graduated as an A.B. student with concentration in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.princeton.edu/&#34;&gt;Mathematics Department&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.princeton.edu/&#34;&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, as well as certificate programs in the Center for Information Technology Policy’s Technology and Society Track and also the Program in Latin American Studies History and Society Track. My advisors were Prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://mracz.princeton.edu/&#34;&gt;Miklos Racz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/fernando-coda-marques&#34;&gt;Fernando Codá Marques&lt;/a&gt;. For high school, I attended the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aps-pr.org/&#34;&gt;Academia del Perpetuo Socorro&lt;/a&gt; in my native homeland island of Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research interests include applications of game theory for problem scenarios such as extensive games in the global cryptocurrency market. Currently, I am studying game theoretic models and I am learning about artificial intelligence and related computing subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received numerous accolades for my distinguished service during my extended tour of duty in the network operations and information technology sectors of the enterprise grade telecommunications industry field. These recognitions include BroadWorks Certified Operational Engineer for Voice over I.P. and Cloud-based unified communications platforms, Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) Network Plus Administration as well as ATT Six Sigma program Black Belt Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of research, I am a proud father of two wonderful children and thus I have no time for anything else. Please send help. I also an active participant in &lt;a href=&#34;http://princetoncatholic.org/&#34;&gt;The Princeton Aquinas Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the catholic community at Princeton, as well as the Newman Centers for U. Penn and N.J.I.T. Newark.&lt;/p&gt;
